1. What is the difference between bean factory and application context?
->  BeanFactory is the basic Spring container that provides Dependency Injection and supports lazy loading of beans. ApplicationContext is a superset of BeanFactory that provides additional enterprise features like 
   internationalization, event propagation, annotation support, and by default eagerly loads beans. In real-world projects, we generally use ApplicationContext.

2. What is the difference between spring core module and spring context module?
-> Spring Core is the base module that provides IoC and DI using the BeanFactory. Spring Context builds on top of Core and provides ApplicationContext with enterprise features like event handling, 
   internationalization, resource loading, and annotation-based configuration. In real projects, we generally work with Spring Context.
